            "Summary" : "(I should change this ad Dermatology's summary)Plastic surgery includes the management of major burns, reconstruction of congenital malformations, cosmetic surgery and other minor surgical procedures. Although many plastic surgeons concentrate on cosmetic procedures, there is a great opportunity for major reconstructive surgery that can be done with an understanding of the principles of wound healing, skin flaps, and skin grafting. There is ample opportunity for innovation and synthesis of new approaches (e.g., craniofacial surgery, microsurgery, fat transfers and artificial skin). Plastic surgeons treat a wide variety of clinical disorders including congenital and developmental problems, trauma, cancer and degenerative diseases. Often their goal is not only to improve appearances but also to restore function. Depending on the type of practice, many procedures are done under local anesthetic on an outpatient basis.
